- **Date Flexibility**: Support for retrieving prayer times for any specified date.

### Target Audience
This project is aimed at developers building applications or services for the Muslim community that requires access to prayer times, as well as individuals interested in integrating prayer time features into their own applications.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Requests library (if further extensions are planned)
- Node.js and npm (for the React client)

## Installation Instructions
To install the necessary dependencies and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prayer-times-api.git
   cd prayer-times-api

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Python dependencies:
   pip install Flask requests

4. Navigate to the client directory and install React dependencies:
   cd client
   npm install

## Usage Examples
To start the API, run the following command in your terminal:
python app.py

To start the React client, open another terminal and navigate to the client directory, then run:
npm start

Once both the server and client are running, you can access the prayer times by sending a GET request to the following endpoint:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/prayer-times?location=YourLocation&date=YYYY-MM-DD
For example:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/prayer-times?location=NewYork&date=2023-10-01
